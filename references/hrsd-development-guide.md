# HRSD Development Guide

Use this as the first compact model guide for HRSD HR Service, Lifecycle Event, Journey Designer, activity, and HR task-template work. PDI metadata and OOTB examples inspected 2026-05-18.

## Key Tables

| Concept | Table | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HR Service | `sn_hr_core_service` | Employee-facing service. Key fields: `name`, `fulfillment_type`, `service_table`, `template`, `producer`, `topic_detail`, `hr_criteria`, `le_type`, `journey_config`, `flow`. |
| Lifecycle Event type | `sn_hr_le_type` | Journey/Lifecycle definition. Key fields: `title`, `event_type`, `display_activity_set`, `sort_activities_by`, `active`. Active PDI examples include Onboarding, Offboarding, Parental Leave, and custom Simen demos. |
| Journey configuration | `sn_jny_journey_config` | Visual Journey Designer config linked from `sn_hr_core_service.journey_config` and `sn_hr_le_type`. |
| Activity Set | `sn_hr_le_activity_set` | Stage/column under a Lifecycle Event. Key fields: `le_type`, `title`, `display_title`, `display_order`, `trigger_type`, trigger date/table/field, dependencies, condition table/condition, display booleans. |
| Activity | `sn_hr_le_activity` | Card inside an Activity Set. Key fields: `activity_set`, `title`, `activity_type`, `order_number`, `owning_group`, plus exactly one target pattern such as approval fields, `hr_template`, `hr_service`, `catalog_item`, `order_guide`, `flow`, `email_template`, or `plan_type`. |
| HR Template | `sn_hr_core_template` | Template record used by HR Services and HR activities. For HR tasks, it normally has `table=sn_hr_core_task`, `parent_case_table`, `assignment_type`, assignment/due-date fields, and an encoded `template` containing `hr_task_type` plus type-specific fields. |
| HR Task runtime | `sn_hr_core_task` | Generated to-do/task table. `hr_task_type` controls the task experience. Type-specific fields include `hr_service`, `sc_cat_item`, `order_guide`, `employee_form`, `survey`, `url`, `hr_task_document`, `meeting_*`, `integrating_system`, and Journey Accelerator plan fields. |
| Activity field mapping | `sn_hr_le_activity_field_mapping` | Maps parent case fields to generated cases, tasks, requests, or Flow inputs. Verify `valid=true` when the platform supports validation. |
| HR Criteria | `sn_hr_core_criteria` | HRSD wrapper for eligibility/audience rules. Often points to `user_criteria`; used on HR Services and some activity logic. PDI examples include Employees Only, New Hire, Office Based Employees, and US Employees - Tax forms Collection. |
| Topic category/detail | `sn_hr_core_topic_category`, `sn_hr_core_topic_detail` | Service taxonomy. Must align with the selected COE/service table; see `references/hrsd-coe-selection.md`. |

## How Lifecycle Event Activities Work

- An HR Service with `fulfillment_type=journey` points to a Lifecycle Event type (`le_type`), Journey config (`journey_config`), intake producer, and HR template.
- The Lifecycle Event type owns ordered Activity Sets. Activity Sets are stages/columns and launch by trigger type: immediate, date, other activity sets, condition, advanced script, combination, or rescind.
- Activities are cards inside Activity Sets. `activity_type` chooses the broad behavior; the target fields choose the concrete generated artifact.
- Employee/Fulfiller activities that create to-dos usually point to an HR Template. The HR Template creates an `sn_hr_core_task` and the template's `hr_task_type` controls the portal/workspace experience.
- Fulfiller activities can also launch child HR Services or catalog items directly through `hr_service`, `catalog_item`, or `order_guide`.
- Flow activities point at `sys_hub_flow` subflows and need field mappings from the parent case into subflow inputs.
- Notification activities use `sn_hr_core_email_content` email content plus recipient fields/users/groups on the activity.
- Activity sets and activities both have conditions. In the PDI, date-triggered activity-set conditions are not reliable gates by themselves; put conditional logic on activities when suppression matters.

## Activity Types

| Activity type | Value | Use when | PDI examples / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approval | `approval` | A manager, group, or HR approval must block or govern downstream work. | Use `approvers`, `approver_users`, or `approver_groups`; tune `approval_accept_option`, rejection behavior, missing approver behavior, and `wait_for_generated_tasks_to_complete`. OOTB example: Manager approval. |
| Employee | `employee` | The subject person, opened-for user, manager, or another employee-facing actor must complete a to-do. | Usually points to an HR Template with `assignment_type=Employee`; examples include benefit enrollment, surveys, videos, uploads, and manager checklists. |
| Fulfiller | `fulfiller` | HR, IT, facilities, payroll, or another support team must complete work or create a child case/request. | Use HR Template for an HR task, `hr_service` for child HR case, or `catalog_item`/`order_guide` for request work. Examples: Background Check, Setup Email, Confirm Final Payroll. |
| Notification | `notification` | The journey should send a lifecycle email without creating a work item. | Use `email_template`, recipient fields/users/groups, and optional availability offsets. Examples: Parental Leave Request Received, Final Exit Email. |
| Flow | `flow` | The activity should run automation/integration logic that is better owned in Flow Designer/subflow. | Point `flow` to a published subflow and create valid activity field mappings for inputs. PDI examples include Account Setup and Notification Subflow and Simen flow demos. |
| Content | `content` | The journey needs display-only content, banner, guidance, or informational material. | PDI example: Separations Banner. Use for read-only information rather than a task. |
| Activity container | `activity_container` | Activities need grouping/nesting under a parent card/container. | PDI examples include Initiate Separation Activities and Onboarding Swag Request. Use sparingly; prefer normal Activity Sets for stages. |

## HR Task Types

The active `sn_hr_core_task.hr_task_type` choices in the PDI are:

| HR task type | Value | Practical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HR Service | `hr_service` | Creates or guides the user into another HR Service from a to-do. Set `hr_service` in the template. Good for child HR Services such as benefit enrollment, payroll setup, or profile completion. |
| Submit Catalog Item | `submit_catalog_item` | Launches a catalog item/request from the journey. Set `sc_cat_item`; map requested-for data when needed. Good for IT equipment, access, or facilities requests. |
| Submit Order Guide | `submit_order_guide` | Launches an order guide. Set `order_guide`. Good when the assignee must choose from a bundle of related items, such as new-hire equipment. |
| Collect Employee Input | `collect_Information` | Presents an HR employee form. Set `employee_form`. Good for structured employee input that is not a full HR case. |
| Checklist | `checklist` | Creates a checklist-style task. Good for manual multi-step work by HR, manager, IT, or facilities. |
| E-signature | `e_sign` | Creates an e-signature task. Set the e-signature configuration field in the template. The old `e_signature` choice exists but is inactive; use `e_sign`. |
| Schedule a meeting | `meeting` | Creates a meeting-oriented task. Use meeting fields such as subject, details, attendees, scheduling method, start/end dates. No active OOTB template was found in the inspected PDI, but the type and fields are present. |
| Mark When Complete | `mark_when_complete` | Simple acknowledgement/manual completion task. Good for "confirm/update/do this outside the platform" tasks. |
| Take Survey | `take_survey` | Assigns a survey. Set `survey`. Good for onboarding, leave, satisfaction, and manager feedback. |
| Upload Documents | `upload_documents` | Asks the user to attach files. Good for leave certification, return-to-work release, receipts, transcripts, or profile documents. |
| URL | `url` | Provides a link to external site, portal page, knowledge article, video host, or third-party process. Set `url` and descriptive text. |
| View Video | `view_video` | Presents a video to watch. Set `url` to the embed/video URL. |
| Auto-close integration task | `action_url` | Integration-style task that can close through an external/action URL pattern. PDI example uses `integrating_system=cicplus` for tax forms. |
| Create Journey Accelerator Action Plan | `create_JA_plan` | Starts a Journey Accelerator plan/action-plan flow. Set JA plan-related fields such as plan type/name/description or auto-create behavior as required. |

Inactive PDI choices observed: Credential (`credential`), old E-signature (`e_signature`), and Sign Document (`sign_document`). Do not use them for new demos unless a plugin/customer requirement explicitly reactivates the pattern.

## Recommended Demo Build Pattern

1. Pick the COE/service table first. Use `references/hrsd-coe-selection.md` for new HR Services and child services.
2. For a journey demo, use `sn_hr_le_case` for the journey parent unless the OOTB example proves a concrete COE parent is intended, as with Parental Leave on Total Rewards.
3. Clone or mirror an OOTB pattern close to the scenario: Onboarding for start-date stages, Offboarding for rescind/separation, Parental Leave for date milestones, child services, and notification-rich journeys.
4. Build the smallest path: HR Service, intake producer, HR template, Lifecycle Event type, Journey config, one immediate Activity Set, and one Activity.
5. Fill the HR Service `description` with approved service-introduction/help text from the design source when available. Do not leave generic placeholders such as "Service for <name>" on employee-facing services.
6. For HR record producers, fill both the employee-facing description and `meta` search keywords. The meta field is used by portal search when AI Search is not the active search path, so include likely employee terms, synonyms, and category words, not only the formal service name.
7. Add a fitting `icon` and `picture` for Employee Center record producers. Use the customer's design system where known: brand colors, restrained line-style iconography, accessible contrast, and relevant imagery. Verify update XML includes the `sys_attachment` and `sys_attachment_doc` payloads for image fields, not only the image sys_id values.
8. For producer deflection, prefer AI Search Assist (`aisa_rp_config`) when the portal has `sp_portal.enable_ais=true` and an active/published AI Search profile exists; keep Contextual Search (`cxs_rp_config`) as fallback. For long free-text HR inquiry questions, the OOTB `ESC AISA Long text to query Search Application` profile is a strong fit because it targets HR knowledge and catalog sources.
9. Prefer Employee/Fulfiller activity plus HR Template for human tasks; use Flow only for automation/integration; use child HR Service or catalog item activity when the result should be a real case/request.
10. Add activity field mappings for any generated child case, request, task, or subflow input. Map to the concrete target table, not generic `sn_hr_core_case`, when the child service uses a COE extension.
11. Before saving or API-creating an HR Service, validate the final form state after choosing fulfillment type, COE/service table, topic detail, template, producer, case options, HR criteria, and related config. Mandatory fields are dynamic and can appear after those choices, such as Opened for / Approver view, Subject person / Task assignee view, and Case creation service config. Fill the dynamic mandatory fields deliberately rather than relying only on base `sys_dictionary` mandatory flags.
12. Verify both design-time records and runtime artifacts: submit the producer or use the HRSD wrapper, inspect generated parent case, activity set contexts, activities/tasks/approvals/requests/flows, and confirm update-set capture.

## Common Pitfalls

- `sn_hr_core_service.service_table`, HR template table/parent table, record producer table, topic detail, and child-service table must agree. Mismatches produce confusing forms, mappings, security, and reporting.
- HR Service descriptions are part of the employee-facing service design. Populate them from the design document or agreed UX copy; do not only update the record producer copy.
- Empty record-producer descriptions and meta fields hurt Employee Center discoverability. Do not leave OOTB placeholder content empty when delivering an employee-facing HR service; add clear description copy and searchable tags.
- Empty or generic record-producer icon/picture fields make services harder to scan in Employee Center. Add branded, relevant imagery and confirm the binary attachment content is captured before promotion.
- Contextual Search and AI Search Assist can coexist on a producer. If AI Search Assist is configured but Contextual Search still appears, verify the portal's Enable AI Search flag, the `aisa_rp_config.active` flag, the AI Search profile's active/published state, and the active search variable on the producer.
- If AI Search portal results find a catalog item/record producer but the action opens `id=form&table=sc_cat_item` instead of `id=sc_cat_item`, check `sp_ai_search_results_action_config` for the portal. Custom/branded portals may be missing from the action config `portals` list for the `ESC Portal Catalogs` source. Add portal-specific navigation and request actions pointing to the `sc_cat_item` portal page instead of changing the catalog item.
- HR Service mandatory fields are partly UI/configuration-driven. The fields required for a valid service can change when fulfillment type, COE/service table, template, producer, case options, HR criteria, views, or case creation service config change. Inspect an equivalent OOTB service or read the configured form state before creating a new service through Table API.
- `sn_hr_le_activity.order_number` orders cards; `sn_hr_le_activity_set.display_order` orders stages. Do not confuse these with generic display order fields.
- Activity Sets can auto-create placeholder stages when a Journey service is created. Remove unintended placeholders and their update XML before delivery.
- Date triggers can target related fields such as `subject_person_job.job_start_date` or `leave_of_absence.first_day_of_leave`; make sure intake variables are copied to real case fields if a date trigger depends on them.
- A date-triggered Activity Set condition may not suppress the set reliably. Put the condition on the activities when task suppression matters.
- `sn_hr_core_template.template` is an encoded field assignment string. Validate required type-specific fields: `hr_service`, `sc_cat_item`, `order_guide`, `employee_form`, `survey`, `url`, e-sign config, or integration fields.
- Flow activities need published/compiled subflows and valid field mappings. Direct Flow tests are not enough; verify the HRSD wrapper path with `sn_hr_le.hr_LEActivityFlow().generateFlowActivity(...)`.
- Creating HR Services and activities through server-side GlideRecord can fail with little error detail in the PDI. Prefer Table API writes for these metadata records and then verify update capture.
- Avoid cloning invalid OOTB/demo mappings blindly. Some baseline mappings target generic tables or show invalid validation state.
